# grpc-client-server-test
A playground for testing out gRPC server and client

`protos/` contains the protobuf definitions that create the common gRPC interface.
`server/` contains a gRPC server in NodeJS
`node-client/` contains a simple gRPC cilent in NodeJS
`reactnative/` contains a simple react native app, which is not yet connected to gRPC

Each folder has a README for more information.

The `server/` and `node-client/` currently provide usable code. Try them out.
